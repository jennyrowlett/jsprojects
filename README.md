# jsprojects

I have created these projects in order to learn JavaScript. All of the projects utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For each project, I went beyond what was taught in the tutorial.

These projects are based on the following books/courses:

- JavaScript Crash Course by Nick Morgan
- Hands-On Projects with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by Dr. Sahand Ghavidel

Here are the project descriptions and my additions.
